# Multiplayer-2D-Shooter---NeonShooter
Neon Shooter is a multiplayer 2D shooter game (Inspiration taken from Diep.io) created using Astran Game Engine for my Data Comm &amp; Networking assignment. It is a two player game where player able to fight against each other in realtime over the network. Since this is a realtime shooter game, it uses Prediction (using of Velocity and Acceleration to predict the next position to move to) and Interpolation (interpolating from current position to position received over the network) method to compensate for the lag since network update runs on 30 FPS, while the game runs on uncapped FPS.
